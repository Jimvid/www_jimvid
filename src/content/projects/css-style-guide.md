This is the styleguide I use when i write vanila CSS (When I'm not using tailwind ðŸ˜‰). It's something I put together as a way too comfortably write modular, scalable and maintainable CSS.

I have taken a lot of inspiration from other methodologies like SMACSS, BEM and OOCSS but is striving to be simpler and a bit more general.
