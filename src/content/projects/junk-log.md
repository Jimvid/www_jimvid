[JunkTracker](https://junk.jimvid.com) is a simple web app that I made to track all the junkfood/overeating that I consume instead of logging everything that I eat. A reversed way to track my eating habits. It has a very simple UI similar to the Github contributions.

Code on <a href="https://github.com/Jimvid/JunkTracker" target="_blank">Github</a>.
